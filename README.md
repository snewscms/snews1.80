# sNews 1.80


## Codename: sNews Reborn!


Welcome to [sNews] 1.80 a single engine file, template independant, PHP and Database powered, standards compliant Content Management System (CMS). 

sNews consists of one engine file (snews.php), one config file (config.php), one admin file (admin.php), one language file (EN.php), one XHTML file (index.php) for content presentation, one stylesheet (style.css) for content styling, one javascript file for functionality and addons folder to extends functions with modules. This makes sNews the lightest and one of the most user-friendly CMSs available today.

**Before installing, please check that your server meets the minimum system requirements:**

  - [Apache Server] with mod_rewrite module enabled
  - One Database with PDO connection: [MySQL] / [sQLite] ...
  - [PHP] : Hypertext Preprocessor, minimum version 5.1
 


### Fits any OS (Linux, Mac, Windows)

Apache, MySQL and PHP are all Open Source applications and freely available. They come preinstalled on Mac OS X 10.2.8 and later; they can be installed both on Windows and Linux OS (detailed info can be found on their respective websites) and they form the most widely used database server setup on the Internet today. For best result in a local server environment though, we suggest that you use a dedicated server stack (applications bundle): LAMP (Linux), MAMP (Mac) and XAMPP (Windows) are the recommended stacks at this time.
